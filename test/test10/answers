Methods of React Components
	11) list all lifecycle methods in React component in sequence?
			when do we use each method? any real time use cases if known? 
			Explain each method with an example and description?

in life cycle methods there is a sequence we can maintain or do not 
 
 Component life cycle methods
Each components has  life cycle methods that you can override to run code at particular times in the process methods prefixed with will are called right before something happens and methods prefixed with did are called right after something happens 

Mouniting 
These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the dom 
Constructor 
Componentwillmount 
Render
Componentdid mount

Updating 
An update can be caused by changes to props or state these methods are called when a componenet is being rendered
Component will recieveprops
Shouldcomponent update 
Component will update 
Render
Componentdid mount 


Unmounting 
This methods is called when a component is being removed from the dom

Component will mount 
Component  will mount is invoked immediately before mounting occurs ,it is called before render ,there fore setting state synchronous in this method will not trigger a re rendering ,avoid introducing any side effects or subscription in this method 
This is the only lifecycle hook called on server rendering generally we recommend using the constructor 


Component did mount 
Component did mount is invoked immediately after a component is mounted initialization that requires dom nodes should go here .if you need to load data from a remote endpoint this a good place to instantiate the network request setting state in this method will trigger a re rendering
