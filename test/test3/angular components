what are componenets in angularjs?
they are simpler configuration than plain directive and promote sane defaults and best practices optimized for componenet based architecture,, writing component directives will make it easier to upgrade to angular 

there is function component, type component, service component filter component provider component etc 
then to top it off i found that a module component is a component consist of directives services filters providers ,templates global API and testing mocks ,


components roughly  called as directives if we want to update to angular 2 we should use components 


app.directives ('list',function(){
	  return{
	  scope:{
	  items:'='
	  }
	  
	  templateur:'list.html',
	  controller.function list ctrl(){
	  controllers;'ctrl',
	  bind to controller:true
	   }

       }

   }}

*******************************
.component
appcomponent('list',{
	bindings:{
	items:'='
	templateurl:'list.html',
	controller.functionlist ctrl(){

	}
	}
})

what is difference between components and directives 

   in components we use components@meta data
   it is simpler configuration 
   easy to understand 
   used to create the ui widgets
   used to break the components  into smaller components 
   uses controllers as syntax 
   uses controllers instead of link


   directives 

   Directive could be A attributes E elements C class M method
   in directives we use directives@meta data 
   directives should be used when you want the DOM application used outside the angular event loop

  4q, when to use components instead of directives
   directive should be used when you need to create the DOM manipulations outside the angular loop

  
   if we want to write the complex code which is easy to understand in components we can use directives but components which is roughly called as a UI directives


   5, lifecycle methods in angular components ?
   ngOnChange
   ngDoCheck
   ngAfterContentChecked
   ngAfterContentlnit
   ngOnViewChecked
   ngOnDestroy

   what are bindings in components
   explain with <, @, =, & with examples (code snippet)
	-- diff between controller with $scope and controllerAs Syntax with this keyword. why do we use them? why is it a good practice to use it?
	-- intercomponent communication with example in angularjs?

bindings are like directives 
The ngBind directive sets the text content of an element with the value of a given expression and updates the text content when the value of the expression changes

in other words ng-bind="somevalue"

replaces the text content of the element with the value of $scope.SomeValue
updates the text content pf the element when the value of $scope.somevalue changes 

this directive as the form 
as attribute 

<ANY ng-bind="expression">
...
</ANY>

as css class
<ANY class="ng-bind:expression;">
...
</ANY>

ng - bind is preferred if a template is momentarily displayed by the browser in its raw state before angular compiles it since ng -bind is an element attribute it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading

Arguements 

ng bind type is expression the expression to evaluate

the example binds a scope variable 'name' to an input element then using an expression to display the value of the variable 

Angularjs/html
name:<input type ="text" ng-model="name"/>
<br/>
message:hello,{{ name }}

javascript
<script>
 angular.module("my app",[])
  .controller("Example1controller",function($scope){
  $scope.name = "world";
  }
  );
  </script>

  ng Nonbindable directive tells angular not to compile or bind the componenets of the current DOM element this is useful if the element contains what appears  to be angular directive and bindings but which should be ignored by A ngular this could be the case if you have a site that dispalys snippets of code for instance 


  the directive as the form
  as attribute
  <ANY>
  ...
  </ANY>

  as css class
  <ANY class="=" ">...</ANY>

  example the following code fragment uses the ngnonbindable directive to display an expression instead of evaluate it

  angular js html
  <div>Normal: {{ 1 + 2 }} </div>
  <div ng-non-bindable>Ignored:  {{ 1 + 2 }}</div>

  javascript 
  <script>
   angular.module("myAPP", [])
   .controller("Example1controller", function($scope) {
   }
   );
   </script>

   output will be 3 

   6.what are directives in angular js and why do we use them?
	-- what are custom directives in angular js? 
		-- write all the below features by examples (code snippet are manditory) for all below features?
			-- restrict
			-- scope (shared, isolated, inherited), 
				-- isolate scope with @, =, &
			-- template, 
			-- templateUrl
			-- transclude,
			-- link,
				-- scope, element, attrs


directives could be elements class attributes methods
we can create our own custom directives
 A-arttributes E-elements C-class M-method

 A. shared scope(false)

every model defined in the parent controller will be available in the directive



B.inherited scope(true)child scope

every model defined in the parent controller will be available in the directive

every model defined within the directive will not be available outside

C.isolated scope{ }


every model defined in the parent controller will not be available in the directive

every model defined within the directive will not be available outside


7.Explain Factory and service by example and theory?
	-- Diff between Factory and service?

uses singleton their should be only one object through out the application

Factory

it is a singleton application
uses return keyword
shared between the controllers
we can return any data type undefined ,number,boolean etc..



service
uses this keyword
it gives object back 
shared betweeen the controllers

Restful Web services & http & promises:
	-- What are RESTful web services?
	 nodejs ,java.dotnet...
webpage-----restful webservices implementation-----database
it supports the http protocol


	-- Why do we use RESTful web services within ui?


we can acess restful web services using http url methods
can support xml,json custom defined message formats

	-- What Do we use to invoke RESTful web services from UI(javascript)? 
	-- What are http verbs? why do we use the following http verbs?
		-- GET, post, PUT, Delete
GET, ---retrive the information
post, ---create the new record
PUT, ---modify or change the existing record
Delete----completley delete thr record

	-- what are http status and why do we use them?
	-- what are the commonly used HTTP Status code? what is the meaning of each HTTP status code? 
200---sucess
201(created)
400-----client side error
400--bad request
401--not authorized
403---forbidden
404--not found
500---server side error
510,503,504



	-- Explain $http and $q with example?

$http---using this we can make the ajax calls
$q---promises


-- What is a promise? what is deffered object? Why we use them?
synchronous (blocking code)
asynchronous(unblockig code)
we have 3 methods 
1.resolve
2.reject
3.promise.then(resolveFunc,rejectFunc)
	-- What is promise chaining? why do we use them?
	-- what are providers in angular js?
	-- what is the sequence of executions? 
		-- config method, run method, directive template, directive link function, controllers
1.configuration method---first this method is executed
2.run method--suppose if you have js code to be executed before anything in application load
3.directives--loaded before the controllers
4.controllers---controllers arec loaded and executed
5.directive link function


-- what is promise chaining? write a sample code?
var fs =require('fs');//fs.read file does not wait for the line to be executed it jumps to the next lineafter that the program is executed call back funnction would be invoked
NON BLOCKING CODE(ASYNCHRONOUS)
EXAMPLE:
console.log('program has started');
fs.readFile('notepad.txt,'UTF-8',function(err,data){
	if(err){
	console.error(err);
	return;
	}
	console.log(data);
	console.log(file write operation is complete)
	console.log('program is ended');
}

BLOCKING CODE(SYNCHRONOUS)
EXAMPLE:
var result=fs.readFilesync('FileName',encoding)
example:
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
setTimeout(function(){
	console.log(3)
},10000);
setTimeout(function(){
	console.log(4)
},0);
console.log(5);
console.log(6);


synchronous----1,2,3 wait for 10 seconds 4,5,6 is executed
asynchronous----1,2,5,6,4,3 is executed it does not wait 


	
	-- what is callback hell? what is solution for to avoid call back hell?

function passed as a parameter into another function so that the function could invoke and execute at the endfs.readFile(....,function(){
	
})


promise channing is used instead of call back hell
clean way to write the code 
easy to understand
re organise the code would be much easier




.run method
is used to strat the application working
 .config
 is used to provide registration and configuration phases
